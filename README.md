# WEBPT15 Review #1

This is an additional optional review for your first Sprint challenge.

I will do my best to whip one of these up for you all before each of your Sprint challenges so that you can go into it feeling more confident. 

## Steps:
1. Fork the repo to your GitHub
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Use `git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'` to create your own branch to work on.
4. View the design mockup and work based on that

### MVP Requirements:
1. Use flexbox to manage your styling
2. Have the following:
    1. A `header` with a logo of any company / brand you'd like with a navigation menu to the side of it.
    2. A `section` with 10 boxes neatly organized with flexbox (feel free to play around with sizing and make however many rows you want, but there should be at least __two__ boxes on each row).
    3. A `section` that has three columns of information (think `divs`). These columns should have a heading `h2-h6` and a paragraph. The paragraphs can be about anything you want.
    4. A `footer` with another navigation menu reflecting the same links you have in your top navigation menu (should be styled differently, just links titled the same)

Again, this is totally optional, but will be VERY good practice for your first Sprint challenge. I recommend at least making one attempt. 

I will do a quick run through as a guided project during our standup, but doing another run by yourself will be beneficial for tomorrow.

Good luck!
